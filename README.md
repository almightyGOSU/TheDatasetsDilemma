## Outline
In our paper, we try to address the "datasets dilemma" using 3 main steps.
1. ***How*** are different datasets being utilised in recent papers?
   - Are there any patterns?
   - Code can be found in the ``./Step 1/`` folder (Please refer to its [README file](https://github.com/almightyGOSU/TheDatasetsDilemmaWIP/blob/e8a90f61977db22e879f2b28f2c647df329e77ae/Step%201/README.md))
2. ***What*** are the similarities as well as differences between various datasets?
   - Can we define them using objective measures?
   - Code can be found in the ``./Step 2/`` folder (Please refer to its [README file]())
3. ***If*** the choice of datasets used could influence the observations and/or conclusions obtained
   - Empirical study using a variety of item recommendation algorithms
   - Code can be found in the ``./Step 3/`` folder (Please refer to its [README file]())

**The ``./Datasets/`` folder**
- ``./Datasets/Source/`` contains the raw datasets
- ``./Datasets/Preprocessed/`` contains the preprocessed datasets
- The dataset characteristics (as well as other information) for all 51 datasets: [characteristics_all.txt](https://github.com/almightyGOSU/TheDatasetsDilemmaWIP/blob/194e3d888a753d68ffd0c05d777d68a339a2ca6b/Datasets/characteristics_all.txt)
  - Basic Dataset Information (in a table format): [characteristics_table_basic_detailed.txt](https://github.com/almightyGOSU/TheDatasetsDilemmaWIP/blob/194e3d888a753d68ffd0c05d777d68a339a2ca6b/Datasets/characteristics_table_basic_detailed.txt)
